TACO is a growing image dataset of waste in the wild. It contains images of litter taken under diverse environments: woods, roads and beaches. These images are manually labeled and segmented according to a hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms. Currently, images are hosted on Flickr and we have a server that is collecting more images and annotations @ tacodataset.org
For convenience, annotations are provided in COCO format. Check the metadata here: http://cocodataset.org/#format-data

TACO is still relatively small, but it is growing. Stay tuned!
